# Flashing Cards

### Plan
* Learn Swift
* Learn SwiftUI
* Learn SwiftData
* Grab song name from metadata as well as filename
* Fuzzy string matching so song names don't need to be entered perfectly
* Spaced repetition until you can name the song given access to the whole thing, then that card is automatically replaced with a shorter snippet until you can name the song after only a second or two.
* Import MP3s (maybe FLAC and/or Spotify support???)
* Gain ability to name every Ye song as fast as you can name runaway
